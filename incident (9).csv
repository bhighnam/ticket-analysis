Huron ticket:
Joel Hansen commented on SC00093364: Harvard - IRB | SFTP Authentication Failed
Good afternoon,

On Saturday 8/19 our security appliance through which this outbound SFTP traffic flows through was rebooted. This appliance had its security keys rotated from the reboot, which altered the perceived SFTP fingerprint as it's decrypted and re-encrypted based on the host security key. 

We've whitelisted outbound traffic from these servers to no longer be decrypted/ re-encrypted so it will no longer change when the secrurity appliance keys are rotated at various times. 

The act of whitelisting the outbound traffic itself presents a new fingerprint key to the SFTP server as it's techincally different now that it's no longer being decrypted & re-encrypted, so after the whitelist change (Friday 9/15) it was necessary to reconfigured these ""new"" fingerprint keys. The timing of this changing happened to coincide with this month's maintenance window.""

Feedback from Monica:
The department wasn't happy about the response. They use this tab for projections and for them it doesn't represent the true expenditures over time.

Dept response: There is no point in this part of the report then as it doesn't represent the lab expenditure in full. The fact that some projects dropped out doesn't mean that the lab is going to spend less. Personnel needs to be reallocated. The experiments costs need to be shifted to other grants.

- We encountered an issue this week due to a major version update of WinSCP that was patched over the maintenance weekend on the IRB production server, which manages the file transfer of GMAS data. 
- I worked with Huron to inform them of the issue and exception errors we encountered. They have since uninstalled the 6.3.3 version and re-installed the legacy version (5.19.2), which addressed the issue. Yesterday afternoon, at 4:30 p.m., the job ran correctly, connecting and pulling the file. We had to do some work behind the scenes to make sure that it copied the correct file to the server for digestion.
- The root cause was a version change. Huron conducts weekly vulnerability scanning to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities and "" end-of-life"" unsupported versions of various software. 
- In the latest review, Huron identified multiple servers with an out-of-date version of WinSCP across their servers, including ours. Dependencies and potential impact were reviewed, and it was deemed a relatively safe patch to apply across all servers with this potential vulnerability during the maintenance window. Unfortunately, our server had an unanticipated dependency on the specific version of WinSCP. 
- I've shared the impact of this automated patch with Huron, and they have mentioned this to their security team to ensure that they check dependencies for future patches. I have offered to complete testing with them on the IRB Stage environment to connect to the SFTP Server, as I would like to ensure we are not utilizing a vulnerable application.
- Today, I completed the GMAS file upload that was missed due to the outage and also reloaded today's file to ensure the sequencing is correct moving forward on the server. ",,,0,CADM^HUIT^Admin Tech Serv,,5
